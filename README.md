# CSE4020-MachineLearningLabs

Experiments of Machine Learning Labs:

* Lab 1 - Decision Tree on AMEO dataset.
* Lab 2 - Data Preprocessing in AMEO dataset and Iris dataset.
* Lab 3 - Perceptron on AMEO dataset and Iris dataset.
* Lab 4 - Linear Regression on AMEO dataset and Iris dataset.
* Lab 5 - Logistic Regression on AMEO dataset and Iris dataset.
* Lab 6 - Multilayer Perceptron on AMEO dataset.
* Lab 7 - Support Vector Machine (SVM) on AMEO dataset with hyperparameter tuning for finding the optimal svm model.
* Lab 8 - Performed Bagging and Boosting on the Wine dataset..
* Lab 9 - Performed PCA and KPCA on AMEO dataset and checked the effect on the performance of the SVM model. The same was also applied for the Wine dataset and the performance was checked for Logistic Regression model
